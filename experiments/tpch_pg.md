# TPC-H Dataset

Reference: [TPC-H with Postgres](https://ankane.org/tpc-h)

### Get TPC-H kit customized by Andrew Kane

```bash
git clone https://github.com/gregrahn/tpch-kit.git
cd tpch-kit/dbgen
make MACHINE=MACOS DATABASE=POSTGRESQL
```

### Create the database and load the schema

```bash
createdb -U postgres tpch
psql -d tpch -U postgres -f dss.ddl
```

### Generate data

```bash
# help information on dbgen
./dbgen --help

# generate 10G data (scale factor = 10)
./dbgen -vf -s 10
```

### Load the data

```bash
for i in `ls *.tbl`; do
  table=${i/.tbl/}
  echo "Loading $table..."
  sed 's/|$//' $i > /tmp/$i
  psql tpch -U postgres -q -c "TRUNCATE $table"
  psql tpch -U postgres -c "\\copy $table FROM '/tmp/$i' CSV DELIMITER '|'"
done
```

### Generate queries

```bash
mkdir /tmp/queries

for i in `ls queries/*.sql`; do
  tail -r $i | sed '2s/;//' | tail -r > /tmp/$i
done

DSS_QUERY=/tmp/queries ./qgen | sed 's/limit -1//' | sed 's/day (3)/day/' > queries.sql
```

### Run queries

```bash
psql tpch -U postgres -c "ANALYZE VERBOSE"
# The following will run forever ...
# psql tpch -U postgres < queries.sql
```

### Add Indexes using Dexter

#### Install [Dexter](https://github.com/ankane/dexter)

Install [HypoPG](https://github.com/HypoPG/hypopg)

```bash
cd /tmp
curl -L https://github.com/HypoPG/hypopg/archive/1.3.1.tar.gz | tar xz
cd hypopg-1.3.1
make
make install # may need sudo
```

Install Dexter

```bash
brew install ankane/brew/dexter
```

#### Add indexes uding Dexter

```bash
for i in `seq 1 5`; do
  dexter -U postgres tpch queries.sql --input-format sql --create
done
```

### Run queries again

```bash
psql tpch -U postgres -c "ANALYZE VERBOSE"
psql tpch -U postgres < queries.sql
```

### Create indexes manually

```sql
-- lineitem
-- create btree on l_shipdate
create index lineitem_l_shipdate_idx ON lineitem USING BTREE (l_shipdate);

-- create btree on l_discount
create index lineitem_l_discount_idx ON lineitem USING BTREE (l_discount);
-- create btree on l_quantity
create index lineitem_l_quantity_idx ON lineitem USING BTREE (l_quantity);

-- create gin on l_comment
CREATE INDEX lineitem_l_comment_idx ON lineitem USING GIN (l_comment gin_trgm_ops);
```

-- Explanation of the optimizations:
/**
Simplified the subquery to get the minimum supply cost for each part key in Europe.
Moved the join with nation and region tables to the subquery to reduce the number of joins in the main query.
Replaced CAST(LOWER(CAST("part"."p_type" AS TEXT)) AS TEXT) with LOWER("part"."p_type") to simplify the query.
Replaced SUBSTR(RTRIM(CAST(LOWER(CAST("part"."p_type" AS TEXT)) AS TEXT), ' '), (CASE WHEN (LENGTH(RTRIM(CAST(LOWER(CAST("part"."p_type" AS TEXT)) AS TEXT), ' ')) - LENGTH(CAST('brass' AS TEXT))) < 0 THEN 1 ELSE LENGTH(RTRIM(CAST(LOWER(CAST("part"."p_type" AS TEXT)) AS TEXT), ' ')) - LENGTH(CAST('brass' AS TEXT)) + 1 END), LENGTH(CAST('brass' AS TEXT))) = CAST('brass' AS TEXT) with LOWER("part"."p_type") LIKE '%brass%' to simplify the query and make it more readable.
Replaced GROUP BY 2, 3 with GROUP BY "part"."p_name", "supplier"."s_name" to make the query more readable and easier to maintain.
